This articles contains the experimental and simulation data for the article Accounting for the Interaction Between a Dummy Finger and Joint
Modular Soft Actuators for Multi-Joint Support Using a Novel FEM-Based Approach published on Robotics and Automation Letters

The FF-SA Complex Model folder contains all the models of our Dummy Full Finger-Soft Actuator Model
The DJ-SA Complex Model folder contains all the models for our DJ-SA Complex Model
The Bending Angle Experiments Folder contains both the experimental and FEM measurements of bending angle for both the Dummy Joint-Soft Actuator and the Dummy Full Finger-Soft Actuator Complex Models.
The Contact area and Displacement Measurements folder contains the contact area and displacement measurements taken from our Dummy Full Finger-Soft Actuator Complex Model on FEM. 

Thank you for your interes and hope this folder is of use to you!
