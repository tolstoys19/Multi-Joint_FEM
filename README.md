This articles contains the experimental and simulation data for the article Accounting for the Interaction Between a Dummy Finger and Joint
Modular Soft Actuators for Multi-Joint Support Using a Novel FEM-Based Approach published on IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.

The FF-SA Complex Model folder contains all the models of our Dummy Full Finger-Soft Actuator Model
The DJ-SA Complex Model folder contains all the models for our DJ-SA Complex Model
The Bending Angle Experiments Folder contains both the experimental and FEM measurements of bending angle for both the Dummy Joint-Soft Actuator and the Dummy Full Finger-Soft Actuator Complex Models.


The Contact area and Displacement Measurements folder contains the contact area and displacement measurements taken from our Dummy Full Finger-Soft Actuator Complex Model on FEM. 

Explanations of how to run our models are provided inside their respective folders!.

Thank you for your interest and hope this data is of use to you!
